## Roadmap for Video AI

### Challenges

Video AI aims to provide fast, efficient, and AI-assisted video creation, but there are several key challenges to overcome. Improving AI-generated video quality remains a priority, as current templates and visuals need more customization and flexibility.

Speech-to-text accuracy must also be enhanced to better recognize different accents and improve multilingual support.

Additionally, AI-powered editing automation is still in early stages, with limited scene structuring and transition recommendations. Another major hurdle is processing speed, as video rendering can be resource-intensive, especially for users with lower-end devices.

Lastly, seamless platform integration is required to allow direct exporting and scheduling of AI-generated videos to platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and other social media networks.


### Goals for the future

- Improve AI-generated video templates with dynamic transitions.

- Enhance speech-to-text captioning with multilingual support.

- Basic AI video trimming & scene structuring for smoother workflows.

- Optimize video processing speed for faster rendering.

- assisted video script structuring - Auto-generate scripts & visuals from text prompts.

- Scene transition & effect automation for smoother editing.

- Social media export functionality for instant content distribution
