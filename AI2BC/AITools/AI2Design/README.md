## Introduction

AI2Design is an AI-powered product design assistant that enhances creativity, efficiency, and collaboration in product development. 

It is designed for industrial designers, UX/UI professionals, and product engineers, offering AI-driven concept generation, material recommendations, ergonomic analysis, 3D prototyping, and market insights. 

By integrating machine learning, generative AI, and real-time collaboration tools, AI2Design helps users streamline the ideation and design process, improving the speed and precision of product development.

## User Story

AI2Design was created to solve the inefficiencies in product design workflows. 

As a product designer, I struggle with iterating design concepts quickly. I need an AI assistant that can generate initial design ideas, refine them based on feedback, and help me visualize them in 3D.

As a UX/UI professional, I want AI-driven insights on accessibility, user experience, and ergonomic data to make my designs more user-friendly.

As a sustainability-conscious developer, I need a tool that recommends eco-friendly materials and sustainable sourcing options.

As a business owner, I want real-time market insights to ensure that my product aligns with industry trends and consumer demand. 

With AI2Design, users bridge the gap between ideation, prototyping, and market validation, making the product development process faster, smarter, and more sustainable.

### Development Objectives

AI2Design is built to revolutionize product design by integrating AI-driven ideation, prototyping, and market analysis into a single seamless workflow.

The goal is to empower designers, engineers, and businesses with intelligent tools that accelerate the design process while maintaining creativity and innovation. 

The platform focuses on improving design efficiency through AI-powered automation, reducing the time needed for prototyping and iteration.

By leveraging machine learning, AI2Design aims to provide real-time feedback on usability, sustainability, and material choices, ensuring that products are both functional and market-ready .Another key objective is enhancing collaboration across teams. 

AI2Design integrates with industry-standard design tools and provides a structured workflow that streamlines feedback, version control, and task management. Future developments will include expanding integration capabilities and refining AI-generated design recommendations to better align with user intent.

## Features
