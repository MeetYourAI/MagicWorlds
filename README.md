## User Story

In developing AI Customer Service Helper, we analyzed real-world conversations and challenges faced by businesses and customers alike. Through countless interactions, we uncovered a common frustration—customer service was either too slow, too impersonal, or too costly to scale effectively.

1. The Overwhelmed Business Owner

   - "I run an e-commerce store, and handling customer inquiries is eating up my time. I can't afford a 24/7 support team, but I need instant responses to keep my customers engaged."

2. The Frustrated Support Agent

   - "Every day, I answer the same basic questions over and over. I want to focus on solving real issues, not copy-pasting answers about shipping times."

3. The Impatient Customer

   - "When I reach out to a company, I expect a fast and helpful response. Waiting hours—or even days—just to get a simple answer is frustrating and makes me switch brands."

From these insights, AI Customer Service Helper was built to:\
✔ Automate repetitive inquiries, reducing wait times and freeing up human agents for complex issues.\
✔ Understand customer emotions and adapt responses for a more human-like, engaging experience.\
✔ Seamlessly integrate across multiple platforms—from live chat to social media, email, and even voice assistants.
